Current benchmark snapshot (10/50)

MA baseline:
- mean_return ≈ 0.00862407
- median_return ≈ 0.01020685
- mean_trades ≈ 2.3
- all seeds positive
- all seeds flat at end

Regime strategy (current robust setting):
- mean_return ≈ 0.06329184
- median_return ≈ 0.06355183
- mean_trades ≈ 65.1
- all seeds positive
- all seeds flat at end

Best current regime one-run:
- end_equity ≈ 106692.8442
- total_return ≈ 0.06692844
- num_trades = 58
- max_drawdown ≈ -0.01960914

Rejected nearby setting:
- SPREAD_TH = 0.0009 gave a stronger one-run result
- but 10-seed robustness was worse:
  - mean_return ≈ 0.05328369
  - mean_trades ≈ 71.7
  - one negative seed
- conclusion: SPREAD_TH = 0.0010 remains the better robust choice

Key fixes now in repo:
- preserve last nonzero signal across neutral bars
- cancel residual remainder after partial fills
- stricter breakout confirmation in RegimeAwareStrategy
- stronger default SPREAD_TH = 0.0010
